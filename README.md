# Password-Guessing-Game
Password Guessing Game through Arduino

1. Design a circuit using a photocell as input.
2. When you press a button, the input of the photocell is recorded as your password. But you have no idea what it is.
3. Try to guess the password. Input your guessing in the Serial Monitor and send it back to Arduino.
4. Arduino will send back “too large” or “too small” in the Serial Monitor until you are correct.
5. Use a LED to show if you made right guessing.
